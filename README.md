# RN_hackathon
Little competition between students.
Goal - based on signals type (aka clusters) calculate reservoir depths.

#1 Task:
With clusterisation algorithms determine type of signal (aka well logging type)\n
I used simplest - knn

#2 Task:
With domain knowledge (which I don't have) calculate reservoir depths.\n
I used simplest - median by cluster

Result - TOP20 solo out of 200 teams :smirk_cat:
