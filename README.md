# RN_hackathon
Little competition between students.
### Goal - based on signals type (aka clusters) calculate reservoir depths.

### 1 Task:
```
With clusterisation algorithms determine type of signal (aka well logging type)
I used simplest - knn
```
### 2 Task:
```
With domain knowledge (which I don't have) calculate reservoir depths.
I used simplest - median by cluster
```
Result - TOP20 solo out of 200 teams :smirk_cat:
