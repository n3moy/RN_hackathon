# RN_hackathon
1 day competition between students.  
### Goal - based on signals type (aka clusters aka well logging type) calculate reservoir depths.

#### 1 Task:

With clusterisation algorithms determine type of signal  
I used simplest - knn

#### 2 Task:

With domain knowledge (which I don't have) calculate reservoir depths.  
I used simplest - median by cluster

Result - TOP20 solo out of 200 teams :smirk_cat:
